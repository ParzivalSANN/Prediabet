# Login Screen Implementation Complete

The Login Screen has been successfully implemented with the following features:

1.  **High-Fidelity UI**: Matches the provided HTML design with a dark theme, mesh gradient background, and glassmorphism card.
2.  **Turkish Localization**: All text has been translated to Turkish (e.g., "Giriş Yap", "Hızlı Erişim").
3.  **Navigation**: The app now starts with the Login Screen. It includes navigation to the main Dashboard ("Panele Devam Et") and direct access to the Risk Test ("Hızlı Test Erişimi").

## Verification
Please reload the application (press `r` in the Expo terminal) to see the changes. 
The app should launch directly into the new Login Screen.
